## Detailed Description
**Note:** Installing this Intel generic graphics driver will overwrite your Computer Manufacturer (OEM) customized driver. OEM drivers are handpicked and include customized features and solutions to platform-specific issues. The generic Intel driver provides users the latest and greatest feature enhancements and bug fixes that OEMs may not have customized yet to address platform-specific needs. Users can check for matching OEM versions at OEM websites.

### Highlights

* Windows® 10 May 2020 Update Ready
* Intel Graphics Installer Changes5

This driver is WDDM 2.7 compliant and ready for the Windows 10 May 2020 Update. It introduces support for Dolby Vision and the new DirectX* 12 Shader Model 6.5 compiler on 7th Generation Intel® Core processors or higher (Intel® HD Graphics 610 or higher).

Gears Tactics*, XCOM: Chimera Squad*, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered* verified playable on Intel® Iris® Plus graphics or better.

**Unlocked drivers:** We heard how much our users want the freedom to upgrade their systems to our regularly released generic graphics drivers and enable our latest game enhancements, feature updates, and fixes. As of this release, Intel Graphics DCH drivers are now unlocked to upgrade freely between Computer Manufacturer (OEM) drivers and the Intel generic graphics drivers on Download Center. Simply use the EXE and enjoy the update on your 6th Generation Intel Processor platform or higher, and don’t worry about your OEM customizations, they remain intact with each upgrade and the OEMs can maintain customizations separately via Microsoft* Windows Update. See the Release Notes section *2 for important information about this update.

Any graphics issues found using Intel generic graphics drivers should be [reported directly to Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/contact-support.html). Corporate customers should always use OEM drivers and report all issues through the vendor they purchased the platforms and support through.

Are you still seeing the OEM error preventing the update? See here for [why and a solution](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000056629/graphics-drivers.html).
